# Error Handling Example Smart Contract

This is an example smart contract that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for error handling in Solidity.

## Contract Overview

The `ErrorHandlingExample` contract allows setting a value and provides examples of different error handling techniques.

### Functions

- `requirExample(uint256 _newValue)`: it will check with the existing value. Requires the `_newValue` to be greater than set value using the `require()` statement.

- `assertExample()`: Demonstrates the usage of `assert()` statement by checking that a condition is true. Throws an error and reverts the transaction if the condition is false.

- `revertExample()`: Shows an example usage of `revert()` statement. It compares two variables and reverts the transaction with an error message if the condition is not met.

## Error Handling

Solidity provides several error handling mechanisms:

- `require()`: Used to validate conditions and revert the transaction if the condition is false.

- `assert()`: Used to check for conditions that should never be false. Throws an error and reverts the transaction if the condition is false.

- `revert()`: Used to explicitly revert the transaction and provide an error message.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with this smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Install a Solidity development environment and compiler, such as Remix or Truffle.

2. Deploy the `ErrorHandlingExample` contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.

3. Use a compatible wallet or contract interaction tool to call the functions of the deployed contract.

## Development

If you want to modify or extend this contract, follow these steps:

1. Install a Solidity development environment and compiler.

2. Make the desired changes to the contract code.

3. Compile the updated contract using the Solidity compiler.

4. Test the contract thoroughly to ensure it behaves as intended.

5. Deploy the updated contract to an Ethereum network for production use.
